# Generalized-Models

This repository contains implementations, analyses, and evaluations of various deep learning strategies, using models and techniques such as custom ResNet18, batch normalization, dropout, label smoothing cross entropy. The project is structured into two main sections, each focusing on different datasets, strategies, and optimizations aimed at enhancing model robustness and generalization.
